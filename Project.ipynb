        "\n",
        "Examining the model's procedure will shed light on its operation.  For each new word or sub-word, the model assigns a probability prediction across all tokens in its vocabulary. This conclusion is drawn from the history of tokens used to train the system. Multiple model encoder layers transform these tokens into an embedding, which is subsequently sent on to a decoder. Based on the embedding, the decoder makes predictions about the likelihood of each token in the model's vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tokens having the greatest expected probabilities are always selected by the decoder when the temperature is set to `0.0`. On the other hand, when the temperature is set to `1.0`, the model will pick a word based on the probability it has been given, regardless of whether or not it is the best option.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the choice of `temperature` depends on the task at hand. For a task that requires factual and precise responses, like a Q&A, a `lower temperature` would be suitable. However, for more creative tasks like creative writing or chatbot conversations, a `higher temperature` might be more appropriate to introduce variability and creativity in the output."
