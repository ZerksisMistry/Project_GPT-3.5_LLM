## ü§ñ Introduction
 
<p align="justify">
This repository has the information and the code that I have used in my experimentaitons and writing my dissertaion for my MSc in Advanced Computer Science with AI. Overall, my project, titled "Explanation and Game-Play Capabilities of Modern AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)", delves into the capabilities of advanced and most recently introduced LLMs. It examines their performance across diverse prompts, use-cases, and notably, in strategic gameplay, highlighting their proficiency in providing detailed explanations.

This documentation presents the development and exploration of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (`text-davinci-003 engine`), specifically designed for strategic gameplay analysis and automation tasks. Throughout our study, we experimented with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques to analyse the explainable capabilties of the OpenAI's GPT-3.5 LLM. By harnessing these different approaches, the chatbot not only offers insightful strategic gameplay explanations but also showcases its prowess in automating various tasks and interactions.

## üíª Requirements and Setup

**Prerequisites:**

The notebook was developed in the Colab Jupyter Environment.

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Necessary libraries and dependencies as listed in the Colab Notebook.
- OpenAI Python client


**Installation:**

```
git clone [gh repo clone ZerksisMistry/Project_GPT-3.5_LLM]

!pip install openai        # for the use of OpenAI API Key
!pip install python-chess  # for chess board representation
```

**OpenAI API Setup:**

Incorporate your OpenAI API key:

```
import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
```

Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API Key.

**Usage:**

To engage with the AI chatbot and delve deep into its strategic gameplay insights:
- Open the Google Colab notebook.
- Execute the cells in sequence.
- Use your OpenAI API Key in the respective area to leverage the capabilites of the LLM.
- Experience the chat-bot system powered by GPT-3.5 LLM for prompts and automation tasks.
- Experience the AI's strategic gameplay prowess in the interactive sections.


**Tokenization with TikToken:**

Leverage OpenAI's [TikToken Tokenizer](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for efficient token counting within text strings.


## üìå Presentation Highlights
