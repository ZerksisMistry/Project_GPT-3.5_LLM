# Explanation and Game â€“ Play Capabilities of Modern AI and LLMs

## Introduction

This repository has the information and the code that I have used in my experimentaitons and writing my dissertaion for my MSc in Advanced Computer Science with AI. Overall, my project, titled "Explanation and Game-Play Capabilities of Modern AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)," delves into the capabilities of advanced and most recently introduced LLMs. It examines their performance across diverse prompts, use-cases, and notably, in strategic gameplay, highlighting their proficiency in providing detailed explanations.

This documentation presents the development and exploration of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003 engine), specifically designed for strategic gameplay analysis and automation tasks. Throughout our study, we experimented with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques to analyse the explainable capabilties of the OpenAI's GPT-3.5 LLM. By harnessing these different approaches, the chatbot not only offers insightful strategic gameplay explanations but also showcases its prowess in automating various tasks and interactions.
