# Explanation and Game â€“ Play Capabilities of Modern AI and LLMs

## Introduction

This repository has the information and the code that I have used in my experimentaitons and writing my dissertaion for my MSc in Advanced Computer Science with AI. Overall, my project, titled "Explanation and Game-Play Capabilities of Modern AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)," delves into the capabilities of advanced and most recently introduced LLMs. It examines their performance across diverse prompts, use-cases, and notably, in strategic gameplay, highlighting their proficiency in providing detailed explanations.

This documentation presents the development and exploration of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (`text-davinci-003 engine`), specifically designed for strategic gameplay analysis and automation tasks. Throughout our study, we experimented with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques to analyse the explainable capabilties of the OpenAI's GPT-3.5 LLM. By harnessing these different approaches, the chatbot not only offers insightful strategic gameplay explanations but also showcases its prowess in automating various tasks and interactions.


## Project Resources

Our project, meticulously developed within a Google Colab environment, showcases the versatile capabilities of the GPT-3.5 LLM in diverse scenarios and tasks.

### Features
- **Prompt-Based Interactions:** The code encompasses distinct use-cases for zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, exhibiting the vast scope of GPT-3.5 interactions. It also includes interactive features for the user to continue the conversation with their follow-up prompts or end the conversation.
- **Interactive Gameplay Demonstrations:** Engage with the LLM in strategic and logical games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-Four, and Chess, observing its gameplay strategies and decision-making.
- **Automation Tasks:** Dive into mathematical automation tasks, designed specifically to demonstrate the proficiency of GPT-3.5 in zero-shot prompting scenarios and to understand their capabilites of generating similar examples as the zero-shot prompt provided in the code as an example, automatically solving the generated examples and self-verification of its own responses.
- **Modular Code Design:** Our code is structured for clarity, adaptability, and ease of understanding, ensuring users can follow along and modify as needed.
- **Detailed Comments:** Navigate through our code effortlessly with the aid of comprehensive comments, providing context and clarity for each block of code.
