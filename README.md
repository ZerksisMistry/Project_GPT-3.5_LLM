## ü§ñ Introduction

<p align="justify">
This repository has the information and the code that I have used in my experimentaitons and writing my dissertaion for my MSc in Advanced Computer Science with AI. Overall, my project, titled "Explanation and Game-Play Capabilities of Modern AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)," delves into the capabilities of advanced and most recently introduced LLMs. It examines their performance across diverse prompts, use-cases, and notably, in strategic gameplay, highlighting their proficiency in providing detailed explanations.

<p align="justify">
This documentation presents the development and exploration of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (`text-davinci-003 engine`), specifically designed for strategic gameplay analysis and automation tasks. Throughout our study, we experimented with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques to analyse the explainable capabilties of the OpenAI's GPT-3.5 LLM. By harnessing these different approaches, the chatbot not only offers insightful strategic gameplay explanations but also showcases its prowess in automating various tasks and interactions.

## üíª Requirements and Setup

**Prerequisites**

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Necessary libraries and dependencies as listed in the Colab Notebook.
- OpenAI Python client

**Installation:**

```
git clone [gh repo clone ZerksisMistry/Project_GPT-3.5_LLM]

!pip install openai
```

**OpenAI API Setup:**

Incorporate your OpenAI API key:

```
import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
```

Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API Key.

**Usage:**

To engage with the AI chatbot and delve deep into its strategic gameplay insights:
- Open the Google Colab notebook.
- Execute the cells in sequence.
- Use your OpenAI API Key in the respective area to leverage the capabilites of the LLM.
- Experience the chat-bot system powered by GPT-3.5 LLM for prompts and automation tasks.
- Experience the AI's strategic gameplay prowess in the interactive sections.


**Tokenization with TikToken:**

Leverage OpenAI's [TikToken Tokenizer](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for efficient token counting within text strings.


## üìå Presentation Highlights

Embark on a journey through our comprehensive exploration of various Large Language Models (LLMs). We've delved deep into models such as GPT-4, Google Bard, Claude-2, and LLaMA-2, emphasizing their capabilities with zero-shot prompts. A special focus has been laid on GPT-3.5, assessing its performance across zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompts, as well as its application in automation tasks and interactive gameplay.


**Research Objectives:** Our core mission - assessing LLMs for gameplay and explanatory prowess.

**Literature Summary:**

- **Historical Overview:** From the Turing Test's inception to today's advances, chart the journey of machine comprehension.
- **Research Gap:** Our study targets an unexplored niche: LLMs' strategy and self-explanation in games.
- **LLM Impact:** Recent literature underscores LLMs' transformative potential across varied sectors.
- **Explainability in AI:** AI's explainability is emerging, but methods to assess LLMs need to be more comprehensive for better understanding of the capabilites of the LLMs.
- **Towards AGI:** Lastly, discussions around Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, are abundant but often speculative. The literature revealed a need for empirical evidence to support claims and theories about AGI‚Äôs potential and challenges.

**Methodology:** Methodology encompasses diverse LLM evaluations, strategic gameplay tests in classics, zero-shot math task automation, in-depth GPT-3.5 prompt assessments, specific evaluation metrics, and insights into OpenAI's LLM framework.

**Analysis:** In-depth evaluation of gameplay strategies and explanatory capabilities of LLMs.

**Proposed OpenAI Framework:** Unveil our tailored framework for understanding OpenAI API interactions.

**Conclusion & Recommendations:** Enlisted key findings and our propositions for the broader AI ecosystem.
